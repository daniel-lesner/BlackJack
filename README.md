A cool version of BlackJack made with pygame.

Suitable for a 1920x1080 screen, however, it can also work on larger or smaller resolutions screens.

Dependent modules: pygame, random, sys and pyautogui.

Please install the dependent modules and run the "Main.py" script.

Special thanks to Tudor Gall for heplping me with the design of the game!

PS: game is not 100% finished, it needs some polishing, but it is playable!


To Do List:\
Move settings.py to root folder\
Add end game reset or quit buttons\
Restrict player to double is bankroll is less than new doubled bet\
Add all-in button\

Bugs:\
If player has two identical cards, one of them does not appear on the screen\
When you double and get over 21 and player has 20, you win instead of losing\
