A cool version of BlackJack made with pygame.

Suitable for a 1920x1080 screen, however, it can also work on larger or smaller resolutions screens.

Dependent modules: pygame, random, sys and pyautogui.

Please install the dependent modules and run the "BlackJack.py" script.

Special thanks to Tudor Gall for heplping me with the design of the game!

PS: game is not 100% finished, it needs some polishing, but it is playable!
